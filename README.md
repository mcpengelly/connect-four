## CHALLENGES

- learning swift for the first time
- wiring up data model to UI controls
- win state checking (optimized based on the last checker played to save scanning entire grid after every turn)

## TODO

- do not hardcode player turn order
- do not hardcode input selection
- do not hardcode grid boundary checks
- player nicknames / winner nicknames
- fix unique id warning in rows/columns

## STRETCH GOALS

- arbitrary grid size
- arbitrary player count

### Also...

### Not sure if
- board should be passed around so much in data model, wonder what an FP implementation would look like?
